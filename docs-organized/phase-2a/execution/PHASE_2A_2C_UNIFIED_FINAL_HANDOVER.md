# POOS Unified Phase 2A + Phase 2C Final Handover

Date: 2026-11-05 (Africa/Cairo)
Status: **PARTIAL — safe WS02 subset isolated; no integration PR merge or production release.**

## Git baseline and preservation

- Verified fetched `origin/main`: `d84120559db36e8e9e7fdb73872a30cbc9d4e6e7` (includes merged PR #8 Storefront optimization).
- New clean integration branch/worktree: `codex/unified-phase2a-2c-closure` at `H:\pos-unified-phase2a-2c`.
- Existing dirty source worktrees and their local commits were preserved. A separate private backup at `C:\Users\yosea\.codex\backups\poos-unified-closure-20261105-014347` passed 220/220 checksum checks.
- Reconciliation rows are in `PHASE_2A_2C_RECONCILIATION_MANIFEST.csv`. Generated browser captures and test output were classified out of publication.

## Implemented / tested / delivery state

| Area | Implemented | Tested | Committed | Pushed | Merged | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HR employee child-resource ownership | Yes, from PR #1 commits | Full Go checks are being rerun on clean branch; isolated PG checks pending | Local commits 7075011, a268f9b | No | No | Candidate |
| Subscription admin/trial serialization | Yes, from PR #1 commits | Existing test fixture dependency corrected locally; current full test run pending | Local commit 1816970 plus working test fix | No | No | Candidate |
| Accounting tax/recurring template scope | Yes, from PR #1 commits | Full Go checks are being rerun; isolated PG checks pending | Local commits 63c92cd, b249ac4 | No | No | Candidate |
| Admin Orders batch count | Candidate exists in PR #7 | SQL mock/general historic checks only; required benchmark and live equality/isolation not run | PR #7 branch only | Yes on PR #7 | No | Deferred from integration |
| Storefront request coalescing | Yes | Hosted checks passed | Merged PR #8 | Yes | Yes | On main |
| Phase 2C Dashboard/notification changes | Several are already in earlier merged PRs; remaining source diffs classified in manifest | Prior workstream evidence only | Existing commits | Some pushed | See PR history | Reconcile before further claim |
| Authentication/session, disabled Super Admin handoff | Extensive primary worktree changes exist | Historical focused tests; current combined auth/CSRF/rotation/tenant suite not run | Source worktree commits only where noted; dirty changes not committed here | No | No | Not production-ready |
| Cross-resource WS02 isolation | Broad dirty WS02 changes exist | Prior targeted runs; complete family/forged-context/bulk/worker matrix remains incomplete | Existing PR #1 commits plus dirty worktree edits | PR #1 pushed | No | Partial |

## Phase status

- Phase 2A: **PARTIAL**. Preserve disabled, fail-closed Super Admin handoff. Full authentication lifecycle and broad tenant/restaurant side-effect matrix remain unverified. WS05, WS07–WS10 have documented gaps. Payments (WS03) and CI expansion (WS06) remain deferred.
- Phase 2C: **PARTIAL**. Storefront change is merged. Admin Orders optimization remains unmeasured and unreconciled against dirty WS02 Orders changes. Dashboard cold CLS and warm POS LCP observations remain open; storefront fixture evidence had an invalid `warm-comfort` theme.
- Unified main integration: **PARTIAL**. No new integration commit has been pushed or merged.
- Production release: **NO-GO** until the combined security, browser, performance, CI and review gates pass.

## Remaining blockers

1. Finish Go verification on the rebased PR #1 subset and run its new/changed integration tests against a new tmpfs PostgreSQL database.
2. Fix PR #1 hosted URL guardrail failures; failing source is stale verifier/config test code. The clean rebased candidate is intended to pick up current main fixes, then needs hosted CI.
3. Review and test the 60 uncommitted WS02 paths, particularly tenant/restaurant isolation and the Orders overlap; do not cherry-pick wholesale.
4. Run Admin Orders comparison at page sizes 1, 10, 25, 50: query/detail/item counts, query and HTTP median/p95, payload, exact response equality, and cross-tenant/cross-restaurant negatives.
5. Run the combined four-frontend regression and browser journeys against the actual combined commit. Existing historical app counts are not current results.
6. Obtain required human PR approval. PR #1/#3/#7 currently have no approval decision. Never bypass branch protection.

See `PHASE_2A_2C_UNIFIED_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` and `PHASE_2A_2C_MAIN_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md` for the exact gate evidence. Continue with `PHASE_2A_2C_NEXT_SESSION_MASTER_PROMPT.md`.
