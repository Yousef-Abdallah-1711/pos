# POOS Unified Phase 2A + Phase 2C Final Handover

Date: 2026-11-05 (Africa/Cairo)
Status: **PARTIAL — safe WS02 subset isolated; no integration PR merge or production release.**

## Git baseline and preservation

- Verified fetched `origin/main`: `d84120559db36e8e9e7fdb73872a30cbc9d4e6e7` (includes merged PR #8 Storefront optimization).
- New clean integration branch/worktree: `codex/unified-phase2a-2c-closure` at `H:\pos-unified-phase2a-2c`.
- Existing dirty source worktrees and their local commits were preserved. A separate private backup at `C:\Users\yosea\.codex\backups\poos-unified-closure-20261105-014347` passed 220/220 checksum checks.
- Reconciliation rows are in `PHASE_2A_2C_RECONCILIATION_MANIFEST.csv`. Generated browser captures and test output were classified out of publication.

## Implemented / tested / delivery state

| Area | Implemented | Tested | Committed | Pushed | Merged | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HR employee child-resource ownership | Yes, from PR #1 commits | Full Go checks are being rerun on clean branch; isolated PG checks pending | Local commits 7075011, a268f9b | No | No | Candidate |
| Subscription admin/trial serialization | Yes, from PR #1 commits | Existing test fixture dependency corrected locally; current full test run pending | Local commit 1816970 plus working test fix | No | No | Candidate |
| Accounting tax/recurring template scope | Yes, from PR #1 commits | Full Go checks are being rerun; isolated PG checks pending | Local commits 63c92cd, b249ac4 | No | No | Candidate |
| Admin Orders batch count and scope reconciliation | Reconciled with tenant/restaurant-scoped order reads and writes; response fields retained | Isolated PostgreSQL before/after benchmark at 1/10/25/50 (30 samples each); byte counts and canonical response hashes match; tenant and sibling-restaurant fixtures excluded | `7edaed7`, `e30ffe3` | Yes, PR #9 | No | Local checks and current hosted checks pass; independent approval pending |
| Storefront request coalescing | Yes | Hosted checks passed | Merged PR #8 | Yes | Yes | On main |
| Phase 2C Dashboard/notification changes | Several are already in earlier merged PRs; remaining source diffs classified in manifest | Prior workstream evidence only | Existing commits | Some pushed | See PR history | Reconcile before further claim |
| Authentication/session, disabled Super Admin handoff | Extensive primary worktree changes exist | Historical focused tests; current combined auth/CSRF/rotation/tenant suite not run | Source worktree commits only where noted; dirty changes not committed here | No | No | Not production-ready |
| Cross-resource WS02 isolation | Broad dirty WS02 changes exist | Prior targeted runs; complete family/forged-context/bulk/worker matrix remains incomplete | Existing PR #1 commits plus dirty worktree edits | PR #1 pushed | No | Partial |

## Phase status

- Phase 2A: **PARTIAL**. Preserve disabled, fail-closed Super Admin handoff. Full authentication lifecycle and broad tenant/restaurant side-effect matrix remain unverified. WS05, WS07–WS10 have documented gaps. Payments (WS03) and CI expansion (WS06) remain deferred.
- Phase 2C: **PARTIAL**. Storefront change is merged. Admin Orders batch count was reconciled and measured at commit `e30ffe3`: page-size 50 reduced from 102 to 3 SQL statements, median 291.768 to 11.784 ms, p95 504.784 to 23.033 ms; canonical responses and payload size match. Dashboard cold CLS and warm POS LCP observations remain open; storefront fixture evidence had an invalid `warm-comfort` theme.
- Unified main integration: **PARTIAL**. Candidate through `ec23651` is pushed in PR #9; both hosted checks pass, but approval and merge remain outstanding.
- Production release: **NO-GO** until the combined security, browser, performance, CI and review gates pass.

## Remaining blockers

1. Obtain the required independent approval for PR #9; its current hosted checks pass at `ec23651`.
2. Dashboard has 107 failing tests out of 645 and test-source TypeScript errors; fix and rerun before claiming frontend regression closure.
3. Run authenticated Playwright/browser journeys against a clean candidate stack; none were run in this continuation.
4. Finish the unreviewed auth/session, tenant-resource side-effect, architecture and transaction tasks listed in the Phase 2A tracker. Payments (WS03) and CI expansion (WS06) remain deferred.
5. Obtain required human PR approval. PR #1/#3/#7/#9 have no approval decision. Never bypass branch protection.

See `PHASE_2A_2C_UNIFIED_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` and `PHASE_2A_2C_MAIN_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md` for the exact gate evidence. Continue with `PHASE_2A_2C_NEXT_SESSION_MASTER_PROMPT.md`.

## Continuation update — 2026-11-07

The current PR #9 head is `58f967039079c8eba0cfa322735725bee1d267cc`, based on `origin/main` `d84120559db36e8e9e7fdb73872a30cbc9d4e6e7`. Both hosted checks pass; the PR is open without an independent review request or approval. Current-source isolated backend build, vet and full Go tests pass; the HTTP handler package reports 262 passes and one opt-in benchmark skip. New tests cover forged-scope low-stock alerts and cross-scope inventory adjustments with unchanged-stock/no-movement assertions. Product-handler debug output was removed.

Phase 2A and Phase 2C remain **PARTIAL**. C006 and C012 remain **PARTIAL**. Playwright was rerun at this HEAD and passed 11/11 on the isolated development stack; the four-app production builds predate this SHA. Only the disposable `pos-unified-phase2a2c-e2e-20261107` project, its volumes and network were removed after testing. Post-teardown inventory confirmed `pos-dev` is still running and unrelated projects remain preserved. The owner must invite an eligible independent reviewer and request review. No persistent DB migration, merge, or main-based Docker delivery occurred.
